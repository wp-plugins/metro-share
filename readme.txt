Simply install, activate and visit the "Sharing icons" settings page.

By default, the plugin displays the sharing icons via the_content(), however
you may wish to display it elsewhere. If this is the case, please install
the "<a href="http://geek.ryanhellyer.net/products/metro-share-remover/">Metro Share Remover</a>" plugin and add the code <code><?php do_action( 'metroshare' ); ?></code>
wherever you wish to display the sharing icons.

The plugin is provided with CSS by default, but you can unhook this and add your own. For an example of this, check out the "<a href="http://geek.ryanhellyer.net/products/metro-share-styles/">Metro Share Styles</a>" plugin.
